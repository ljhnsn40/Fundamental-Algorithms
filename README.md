# Fundamental-Algorithms


- Solve the Insertion Sort Neetcode challenge in a language of your choice

- Complete the Reverse a Linked List Leetcode challenge in a language of your choice

- Deliver the code for each problem in your repo for the lab.

- In your README:

1. Provide Big O Notation for each of your solutions

2. Research Quick, Bubble and Insertion sort. Describe which algorithm and how they perform.

3. Research Dijkstra's Algorthim. Describe what problem this algorithm solves and list 2 situations, datasets, or real world applications that the algorithm can be used to solve.
