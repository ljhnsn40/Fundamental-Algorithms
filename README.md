# Fundamental-Algorithms


- Solve the Insertion Sort Neetcode challenge in a language of your choice

- Complete the Reverse a Linked List Leetcode challenge in a language of your choice

- Deliver the code for each problem in your repo for the lab.

- In your README:

1. Provide Big O Notation for each of your solutions
Insertion -  O(n^2)
RL- O(n)

2. Research Quick, Bubble and Insertion sort. Describe which algorithm and how they perform.

Bubble Sort: Imagine rearranging your bookshelf by comparing each book to the one next to it and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. You keep doing this until the books are sorted from smallest to largest.

Insertion Sort: Think of building a house one brick at a time. You start with a small foundation and add each brick to its correct position in the wall.

Quick Sort: Imagine dividing a pile of clothes into two piles: one with clothes smaller than a certain size and one with clothes larger than that size. Then you do the same with each of those piles until all the clothes are sorted.

3. Research Dijkstra's Algorthim. Describe what problem this algorithm solves and list 2 situations, datasets, or real world applications that the algorithm can be used to solve. 

Dijkstra's Algorithm is like a map-reading robot that finds the shortest route between two places. It starts at your starting point and checks all the nearby places. It picks the closest one and repeats the process until it reaches your destination.

Real-World Applications:

GPS Navigation: Your GPS uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the fastest route to your destination, considering factors like traffic and road conditions.
Network Routing: Computer networks use this algorithm to determine the most efficient path for data to travel from one device to another.
